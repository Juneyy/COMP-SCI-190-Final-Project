# COMP-SCI-190-Final-Project

The final class project is to develop a model to detect pulmonary infection (pneumonia) on chest radiographs using any of the approaches and tools you have learned this quarter. The goal is both to create a high-performing algorithm for the target task, as well as to analyze performance across several different architecture permutations. At minimum, three different network designs of your choice will be tested (you are welcome to include more if you've tested others). As each model is built and trained, ensure to serialize the final model `*.hdf5` file before moving to the next iteration.

Result:

#Model 1 accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predicted value is 88.30%, 87.38%, 89.98%, 85.58%, 90.40% respectively. 
#Model 2 accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predicted value is 92.80%, 92.02%, 93.35%, 91.20%, 94.01% respectively. 
#Model 3 accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predicted value is 89.50%, 89.01%, 89.86%, 86.89%, 86.78% respectively.
